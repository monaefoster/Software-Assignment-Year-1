To play the game:
Ensure all requirements are met from the requirements file (e.g. correct applications/files downloaded)

Idea of the game:
My code will run through a separate Pygame window, following the basic idea of the Snake game. The focus of the game is for the player to move the snake object around the grid, attempting to collect as many randomly generated 'snacks' as possible. With each snack collected, the length of the snake will grow, increasing t5he difficulty of the game.

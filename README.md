This repository contains all files required for the Practical Project Report

To play the game:
Ensure all requirements are met from the requirements file (e.g. correct applications/files downloaded) before running the code

Idea of the game:
My code will run through a separate Pygame window, following the basic idea of the Snake game. The focus of the game is for the player to move the snake object around the grid, attempting to collect as many randomly generated 'snacks' as possible. With each snack collected, the length of the snake will grow, increasing t5he difficulty of the game. The game will be over once the snake has collided into itself, and you will then receieve the optiont to play again.

Future improvements:
Game over window added into main Pygame window
Music controlled to stop once the player has lost the game
Start menu to resemble an arcade-style game
Add detail to the snake (e.g. eyes)

Libraries:
Import Pygame
Import Random
Import tkinter as tk
From tkinter import messagebox
